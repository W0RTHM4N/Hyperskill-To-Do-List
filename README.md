# To-Do List
My 11th Python project from Hyperskill.

The program allows user to create a database for storing tasks and their deadlines.

Available actions:
- add task;
- delete task;
- show today's tasks;
- show week's tasks;
- show all tasks;
- show missed tasks.

The database is created using SQLAlchemy ORM and stored in a file "todo.db" in the same directory as the script file.
